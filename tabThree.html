<h2> Unit 1. Outcome 3  </h2>

<h2> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in 
    terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient 
    when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
<div></div>
<p>
        The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems can utilize the 
        productivity of the project and speed up its efficiency while suffering 
        the navigation of the website. When you have a team of coders you can pick 
        out who is more technical, who is more prone to solving solutions and 
        being creative and decide who enjoys doing what. That way tasks can be 
        assigned to do in teams is through stage process of step 1, step 2 and 
        step 3 divided into subsections in a matter of priorities. 
        </p>

<h2>  3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency. </h2>
<div></div>
<p>
    One way to improve productivity is by keeping basic code outline saved in 
    notes which you can go back to and use practice to understand mind mapping
     (architectural enterprise when thinking of the bigger picture and focusing
      on the problem at hand which can be solved through coding not just the
       coding itself) when coding. While working, everybody will have their 
       own styles of work. I work best under pressure so, for me the Pomodoro
        method which results in working in spurs of 20 mins or so is best, 
        as I give high level intensity work and that way I have 5 mins break 
        and repeat. This cycle gives the best outcome when it comes to 
        productivity and efficiency.

<h2> 
3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital 
projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
        </h2>
<div></div>
<p>
        Next time I would identify the skills gap against the clear objectives and use this to make up the time for coding the carcass of the website before I focus on the outcomes.

        We all know that effective communication is crucial for team productivity so, I were to work in a team I would elevate the importance of internal communication which could assist problem solving and team building, while assessing progress.
        Currently, the market offers many advanced technological solutions for businesses of all sizes and cost variables allowing better technologies to solve problems. Another way to improve productivity is to stay organized across workflows with cloud-based project or task management software and using tracking tools to assess the project.

        <h2> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions .
                 </h2>
        <div></div>
        <p> The way I would test digital solutions is through code testing on
             different browsers to make sure these open up any existing problems 
             or broken links. The way to generally test digital solutions through 
             debugging processes. This could be aligned with code testing through
              a professional who specializes in quality assurance i.e. one person 
              would write code and the other could check. Likewise, if I’m working
               on my own I can check code against the desired outcome use online 
               forums and lift code from stackoverflow.  </p>
