        <h1>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h1>

        <h2> 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
              
        <div>
            <p>
              The layout is likened to the layout which I created on Word with subtitles divided into sections based on the questions provided with subtitles coded as:
            </p>
            <h2>About me. People don’t buy what you do.
                     They buy why you do it. Role : Technical Consultant
            </h2>
            <p>
                The content I created will have headings to divide the paragraphs within sections followed by clearly set out paragraphs to answer the question, and if there are 
                two or more paragraphs per question then a HMTL division is used to signify a new line:
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical Consultant  
            </p>
            <p>
                What interests me in technology is the way it can solve
                problems through an acute dimension of high level strategy
                 and tech solutions. The ‘’about me section’’ is on a different page, as well as divided into different section banners. 
                This allows for clear navigation tactics and user friendly experience to differentiate ‘’about me’’, ‘’unit 1’’ and ‘’ unit 2’’ sections. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
            <p>
                Some of the content which I have on my blog is value oriented, likewise some of the information has been lifted or re-written for the purpose
               from other existing sources. If the text is copied straight out of ‘’somebody else's book’’ then the website can get suited for copywriting. Likewise, 
               other constraints can be cost related. Such as hosting costs for the website which may not be productive unless it is making money and improves the ROI
                on hosting spent.
            </p>            
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>  1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
              
            <p>Issues may include visual impairment so, if somebody were to include alt tags on the website and the reader can use a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a
               website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is. This can be a great opportunity to use if you post regular video content which 
              includes videos. Another aspect to include is to provide subtitles for the audience.
              Take alt tags seriously and use them as an opportunity to describe the image accurately and succinctly, as a way to communicate the message. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

            <p>
                The appropriate file types for building a websites are normally those which will run on most internet browsers which include CSS, JavaScript
                 and HTML, as well as different file types for images if you want to use images on my website. The most commonly used file types for images 
                 are JPEG, PNG and GIF. For instance, I have used one image on my website in ‘’about me’’ section which is a JPEG. HTML file contains content for 
                 your website whereas CSS is a styling tool which gives website a specific ‘’look’’ i.e. if you wish to have interactive banners and buttons linking
                  pages than JavaScript is what you would use.
