              <h1>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h1>

              <h2> 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
              
              <div>The layout is likened to the layout which I created on Word with subtitles divided into sections based on the questions provided with  subtitles  coded as:
                 <h2>About me. People don’t buy what you do.
                     They buy why you do it. Role : Technical Consultant
                  </h2>  
                  The content I created will have headings to divide the paragraphs within sections followed by clearly set out paragraphs to answer the question, and if there are 
                  two or more paragraphs per question then a HMTL division is used to signify a new line:
                     Technical Consultant
            
              
                What interests me in technology is the way it can solve
                     problems through an acute dimension of high level strategy
                     and tech solutions. The ‘’about me section’’ is on a different page, as well as divided into different section banners. 
                  This allows for clear navigation tactics and user friendly experience to differentiate ‘’about me’’, ‘’unit 1’’ and ‘’ unit 2’’ sections. </p>
            
                  <h2> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
              
              <p></p>Some of the content which I have on my blog is value oriented, likewise some of the information has been lifted or re-written for the purpose
               from other existing sources. If the text is copied straight out of ‘’somebody else's book’’ then the website can get suited for copywriting. Likewise, 
               other constraints can be cost related. Such as hosting costs for the website which may not be productive unless it is making money and improves the ROI
                on hosting spent.<p></p>
              
                <h2>  1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
              
                <p>Issues may include visual impairment so, if somebody were to include alt tags on the website and the reader can use a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a
                   website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is. This can be a great opportunity to use if you post regular video content which 
                  includes videos. Another aspect to include is to provide subtitles for the audience.
              Take alt tags seriously and use them as an opportunity to describe the image accurately and succinctly, as a way to communicate the message. </p>
              
    <h2> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>

    <p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation which is basically created to regulate the processing of personal data that since 2018 which is all about adjusting the legal regulations 
        concerning the processing and protection of personal data i.e. a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, 
        physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.  For example, if you’d like to know what Spotify knows about you, you can ask them for a copy 
        of all the data they store about you or even ask the company to wipe the entire dataset: your name, email, listening history, and so on.
      For instance, GDPR regulates how companies store data. The constraints this can implement on the projects could be to do with design of how the data flows with the principle of data minimization 
    influencing the scope of collected data, the purposes of their processing, and their retention which need to be reduced to the absolute minimum.  This would influence the processes without which 
    GDPR might  affect the image of your company—for example, if you fail to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data you store and process. Storing data securely can be another issues
     if the company will experience a hack or security breach by allowing access of personal data by employees etc in any inappropriate format. A hit like that is not the best PR and is strictly against 
     ethics meaning certain implementations need to be tested ahead of launch which could also influence cost. The way to avoid making mistakes with GDPR should talk to experts who will help you manage 
     your data flows and point out vulnerabilities in your existing product, website, and database. </p>
