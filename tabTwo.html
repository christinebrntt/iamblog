<h2> Unit 1, Outcome 2    </h2>
<h2> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT 
    tools and change approach as needed – 
    in making your own website, are you happy 
    with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio
     Code, Codepen, Trello   </h2>
<div></div>
<p>
        I am happy with using Visual Studio Code however
         in the future while I practice code and styling 
         in CSS I would use https://flexboxfroggy.com/ to 
         see how it fits or doesn’t work before I use Visual
          Studio Code. Likewise, since this was a solo project
           with specific outcomes, I didn’t refer back to Trello,
            as I depended on mental correlation between desired
             outcomes and current process which are clearly
              directly interlinked. So, if I had a tech project
               to work on I would need Trello as with the brief we 
               would need to consult with the team and pick bits we 
               would want to work on in order of priority to make it
                all come together.  
        </p>

<div></div>

<h2> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual 
    Studio Code, Codepen, Trello. </h2>
<div></div>
<p>  In the instance of this project we didn't use Codepen however Trello was 
    helpful in using kanban method to distribute workload and prioritise certain 
    tasks at hand so, evaluate the progress of the project and the time limits 
    set on it. It was the use of the Xcode was appropriate because we can build
     different file types i.e HMTL and CSS simultaneously thus immediately of
      testing code in real time and between two tabs. 
    </p>

<h2> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are 
    you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the 
    website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 
    </h2>
<p> 
        I would be happy with the website if I would create more navigational
         pages, as I’m used to doing the website in Wix or Wordpress which comes 
         with presets os, it was challenging to get outside of that mindset and 
         start from scratch.  The background web could create a plan for the 
         navigation journey and thus do link testing to make sure there are no 
         broken links. I only had a certain amount of time and limited skills so,
          I could only complete a certain aspect of my objective and next time I 
          would allow more time and close my skill gap.
         </p>
<div></div>

<h2> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  </h2>
<div></div>
<p>Further improvements I can make to the website would be back links to link 
    back to google authority and raise SEO and therefore traffic to monetize 
    the website. Other ones include would be as follows:

        Push buttons not working
        Embedded links don’t redirect
        No wrap text around image
        Navigation panel doesn’t work
        Pages don’t open on two browsers 
        
        </p>
<div></div>

<h2> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit 
    for purpose </h2>
<div></div>
<p>
        I have met the outcomes of the agenda in the project by setting up 
        content page, answering the question, choosing appropriate digital
         solutions through embedding HMTL and CSS styling. The styling takes 
         the consideration of legal and financial constraints.
