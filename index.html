<h2>About me.

        <h2>Prelude</h2>
<div></div>
<p>
        What interests me in technology is the way it can solve 
        problems through an acute dimension of high level strategy 
        and tech solutions.
        </p>
<p>I am particularly interested in VR and how it can help to solve
     medical issues we are experiencing today such as chronic pain 
     through evidence-based techniques from physical therapy, pain, 
     psychology, cognitive neuroscience and functional restoration 
     programs. I’m fascinated how Virtual Reality can be used to 
     elevate patient's condition through neuroplasticity .</p>
<div></div>

<p>My prior experience came from working as an account executive 
    in the advertising industry with experience in digital marketing
     using tools to evaluate insights and psychometrics. 
        Other background includes brand strategy, approving visual 
        design and account management for household clients informing
         mindful but competitive approach. I’m fueled by passion for 
         understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. I 
         consider myself a ‘’forever student’’, eager to both build 
         on academic foundations and sociology dancing between the
          two to the tune of the latest digital marketing strategies
           and professional development.

<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h2>
<div></div>
<p>The purpose of IT in the modern businesses is to provide better 
    solutions, create smoother communication lines, provide automated 
    solutions. Technology enables to carry out tasks effectively in 
    business models who trade time as a commodity with timed delivery
     of tasks assigned to projects and people. If data entry levels are
      entered correctly and optimized it has the possibility of delivering
       predicted timelines on the projects and data points for project 
       managers to assess in order to improve output, productivity and 
       efficiency. 
    </p>
<div></div>
<h2>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete 
        digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects
         successful? What tools? What skills? 
        </h2>
<div></div>
<p>The methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
    successfully is through changing the way businesses communicate:
        Changing the way the business communicates -- technology changed 
        the way people communicate in the workplace which brings value to 
        keeping team workers updated and strategy agile without having to 
        surpass the hierarchy. Technology is a way to keep projects organized 
        \while delegating and reviewing, as well as assessing a task. This 
        creates innovative products to boost efficiency and increase workflow,
         as well as raw data which can be used to evaluate proficiency and 
         cost efficiency.

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. 
        How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. 
       </h2>
<div></div>
<p>I would first write down the required text, visualize the final result 
    and embed the HTML and CSS to achieve the final result. I would decide 
    the headings, subheadings, text and background, as well as fonts and 
    the juxtapositioning of text and paragraphs, as well as using google/fonts 
    to lift appropriate style and colour gamma.  I would have two buttons 
    interlinking the Unit 1 & Unit 2 for clarity focus. 
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what 
        causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
        </h2>
        <div></div>
<p>One of the reasons there might be risk which might impact digital projects 
    is because according to Dr. Dobbs survey on digital execution a few years 
    ago traditional projects on average have a 14% rate of failure. In some 
    instances the failure of digital projects can result in great products 
    have a  product inadvertently remove the back-end information flow required 
    by invoicing which mean the profits and ROI would not be realized. </p>
<div></div>
<p>Many projects fail for several reasons such as misalignment with business 
    processes this often happens when the team put technology ahead of strategy 
    without considering the business implications. Ultimately every digital 
    product needs a whole team  of people not just ‘’tech’’ crowd to fulfill 
    its functionality but also businesses project management to complete alignment
     between customer journey and back end operational processes. Another reason
      it can fail is the limited digital strategy which needs to be aligned with 
      companies general strategy moving forward. One of the reasons, a lot of
       projects fail is because the notion of a ‘’5 year plan’’ is dead. 
       Using agile iterative processes allow frequent tweaks and improvement 
       is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. The digital project 
       plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the 
       company at any given moment. Over ambition i.e. expecting perfection 
       without testing out the products or early versions of the software first. 
       For example, assuming ability to ‘’launch a perfect site within the next 
       3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and 
    software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
<div></div>
<p>You focus on the outcomes and the strategy overall, as well as time scale
     and evaluate the strengths of all team members as well as potential
      risk mitigation for the completion of the project. One of the things
       to consider is website building tools which has multiple options, 
       as well as, website hosting processes to consider because data 
       extracting tools can also cost money depending on the functionality 
       of the website i.e. commercial, informative, blog style etc. For 
       this instance my website was more blog focused to demonstrate learning
        outcomes, techniques and showcase skill. I had access to Xcode to 
        compose HMTL and test it through code nation so, it was an easy 
        choice as it proved low cost and accessible. 
        </p>
<div></div>
<h2>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies 
        have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you 
        plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.
       </h2>
<div></div>
<p>I had access to Xcode to compose HMTL and test it through code nation so,
     it was an easy choice as it proved low cost and accessible. The way to 
     control to push HTML into github which is almost like using google docs 
     if you are in a team, as you would always able to lift the latest version. 
      Trello helped me plan different tasks in chronological order, and having 
      the ability to move the ‘’stickers’’ alongside in kanban style to know 
      exactly where I’m up to and which tasks need to be completed first. 
      Another important aspect to consider is web hosting limited to the 
      budget of the project at hand.</p>
      <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital
           projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation which is basically 
    created to regulate the processing of personal data that since 2018 
    which is all about adjusting the legal regulations concerning the 
    processing and protection of personal data i.e. a name, an identification 
    number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors 
    specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
    cultural or social identity of that natural person.  For example, if 
    you’d like to know what Spotify knows about you, you can ask them for a 
    copy of all the data they store about you or even ask the company to wipe 
    the entire dataset: your name, email, listening history, and so on.
    </p>
<div></div>
<p>For instance, GDPR regulates how companies store data. The constraints 
    this can implement on the projects could be to do with design of how 
    the data flows with the principle of data minimization influencing the
     scope of collected data, the purposes of their processing, and their 
     retention which need to be reduced to the absolute minimum.  This would 
     influence the processes without which GDPR might  affect the image of your 
     company—for example, if you fail to implement appropriate security measures
      to protect the data you store and process. Storing data securely can be 
      another issues if the company will experience a hack or security breach 
      by allowing access of personal data by employees etc in any inappropriate 
      format. A hit like that is not the best PR and is strictly against ethics 
      meaning certain implementations need to be tested ahead of launch which 
      could also influence cost.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The way to avoid making mistakes with GDPR should talk to experts who will 
    help you manage your data flows and point out vulnerabilities in your 
    existing product, website, and database.</p>
